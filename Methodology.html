<h2 style="text-align: center;">Primary Deliverables</h2>

<h3>Watershed Amphibian Monitoring Program</h3>

<p>This deliverable was made through several Esri products known as ArcGIS Survey123, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboards and ArcGIS Experience Builder. First, a Survey123 was created to replicate the paper form BCWA previously used (see Appendix 1). This was created by using Survey 123 Connect which needs to be used for more complex survey creation instead of Survey 123 Web Designer. Each question uses HTML attributes to increase their default font size. There is a total of 38 questions with 15 questions being attributed to the table section being replicated in a series of appearing and disappearing question based on the user’s answer. These questions were created by starting them off as hidden and being viewed based on a surveyor’s answers by using Regex calculation (definition in list of terms, 0.1). The survey also includes the BCWA logo and contact information in case there are any problems. 
After the completion of the survey, 2 dashboards were created, one for the public and one for an administrator in the BCWA. The public dashboard is used in conjunction with the administration dashboard to show results from survey submitters that are approved by the BCWA. The administration dashboard uses a view of the Survey123 results that only shows non- reviewed survey entries. A view is a version of a file that only shows certain data of a file by using a filter. In this case, there is a hidden field in the results called reviewed that is either a 0 (default) a 1 (reviewed) or a 3 (to be deleted). By make, the view only show 0’s and are used as a method for quality control. This view is then placed into the administration dashboard with an additional Survey 123 that references that same view. The administration survey has an additional question on it (is this survey good to share?) that changes the review field to a 1 if “yes” is selected or a 3 if “no” is selected. Then an additional view is created that only shows results with a 1 in the review field which is then placed into the public dashboard that only shows surveys that have been reviewed by the BCWA. 
The public dashboard has 1 additional hurdle that needed to be solved when representing the data. The amphibians recorded by Survey 123 use a multi-select question to take down this data, this is data that comes out in a single field as a comma separated answer ex. “AMTO,SPPE”. The problem with this is ArcGIS Dashboard’s pie graphs sees every different combination of these values as separate categories instead of just the different frog species as categories ex. “AMTO,SPPE” and “AMTO,CHFR” come out as 2 separate groups instead of 3 separate groups to be separated by amphibians. This was solved by using the coding expression section of a pie chart where the BCB used a custom coded pie chart to split the answers into separate categories to represent them properly (code shown in appendix 6.4)  
Lastly, the BCWA wanted a disclaimer splash screen before someone entered the dashboard. The easiest way to do this without ArcGIS Enterprise was to use ArcGIS Experience Builder. To create a disclaimer splash screen, the BCB created a new Experience Builder and referenced the created dashboard to fill up the entire screen. Then, an acceptance window was added as a splash screen to add the disclaimer and the BCWA logo.

<h3>Gap Analysis and Data Acquisition</h3>

<p>The Gap Analysis and Data Acquistion deliverable started with client communication and access to the file geodatabase and data on ArcGIS Online (AGOL). The client then created a list of layers needed for both the project and for future deliverables. 
This list included Southern-Ontario Orthophotography, LiDAR tiles, Significant Groundwater Recharge Area (SGRA), Highly Vulnerable Aquifers (HVA), Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA), Surficial Geology of Southern Ontario Pits & Quarry, Point Features, Linear Features, Surficial Geology and Quaternary Geology; Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest, Provincial Natural Heritage System, Buildings, Ontario Integrated Hydrology, and Indigenous Treaty Boundaries. 
All orthoimagery and LiDAR tiles was requested from LIO through the imagery order form. The SGRA and HVA layers were requested through an email to the Trent Conservation Coalition (TTC) and the WHPA layer was open on the TTC website. All geology layers were open on the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) website. The rest of the layers were open from LIO except for the Buildings layer which was acquired through Bing. The layers and imagery were then either added to the file geodatabase, clipped to the client-specified extent, and then published to AGOL or they were shared to the client through Google Drive (imagery was shared rather than included in the geodatabase to reduce size). 
Throughout this process, a metadata worksheet was created called the Base Data Inventory on Google Sheets (See Appendix 6.3). Metadata such as name, clipping extent, and source was then filled out for each of the layers as the database grew. 
At the end of the data acquisition, a new file geodatabase was created and shared with the client through Google Drive.

<h3>Connection Story Map</h3>

<p>The Community Connection StoryMap was in progress throughout the project as its completion depended on the status of other deliverables. This helped the BCB to track their progress since the StoryMap was a good reference to see which deliverables were completed. 
The StoryMap opens with some interesting historical information around Millbrook, where the BCWA is situated. Since the BCWA is interested in local outreach this draws the intended audiences’ interest since it talks about the history of their home. This includes comparisons from old maps and aerial imagery, compared to the information in the BCB’s reference map, and modern satellite imagery from google. 
The StoryMap then goes on to explain the role of GIS in supporting watershed conservation. It shares information regarding the Anuran Survey123 deliverable, giving an image of the survey and embedding the public dashboard of all the quality-controlled observations, explaining how these observations are good indicators of watershed health, and how Survey123 makes the process of data acquisition to interactive cartographic output seamless. 
The next section is similar, showing the Watershed Watch application and its role in community connections and citizen science. It also shows an image of this Survey123 and embeds the dashboard of quality-controlled observations. This app is one of the main ways the BCWA intends to engage the public and this section of the StoryMap explains how this application can be used.
The next section it covers is the map series, showing an image of each map and linking the watershed hub where they can be downloaded as pdf. It explains that the maps are for reference and are educational resources, it also includes a slider for comparison to a phase 1 map.
The next section is indigenous engagement, it explains how and why the BCWA wants to work with the local indigenous people and then features the print version of the map in much the same way as the maps in the previous section were reported. It also embeds the interactive indigenous engagement web map. 
The final section gives a brief description of the Watershed Characterization dashboard, built on ArcGIS Experience Builder. The experience builder largely features its own descriptions and tutorials, so the StoryMap does not reiterate. It then embedded the content before going to the overall conclusion. Since the LiDAR is covered in both the map series and the experience builder the StoryMap does not dedicate a section to it. 
Finally, the StoryMap concludes restating the BCWA’s goal of an educated an involved public, directing the reader to the BCWA Watershed hub, and giving appropriate credits.

<h3>Watershed Characterization Web Experience</h3> 

<p>The Watershed Characterization Web Experience was created towards the end of the project. To start this application, catchments on the Ontario Watershed Information Tool (OWIT) were delineated and exported with calculated characterization and land use data. This package was then opened in ArcGIS Pro and two maps were created, the Characterization Map and the Land Use Map. 
For the Characterization Map, each catchment/creek shapefile was taken and joined with the characterization table included from the OWIT package. These features were then exported and published to AGOL where a web map was formed. All the smaller creeks were merged into one feature and labelling was then completed for each of the catchments. The map was then linked into the Watershed Characterization Web Experience. The characterization page was then created in Experience Builder where the user could explore each catchment and see the features characterization information.
The Land Use Map was created using the raster files provided in the OWIT package. The raster for each catchment was then converted into polygons and symbolized according to the layer file from the OWIT package. These features were then published to AGOL, and the Land Use Web Map was created. All the smaller creeks were merged into one feature and labelling was then completed for each of the catchments. The characterization tables for the land use were also published to AGOL and connected into the web map. The web map was then added to a new page in the Experience Builder application and pie charts were created (linked to the land use tables) that show the different land use areas for each catchment and their total area by percent. 
For the Home page a combined Characterization and Land Use Map was created that was focused more in-depth on the Baxter Creek. This map contains land type area and many layers based on client specifications such as the SGRA, WHPA, and HVA. A view was created to introduce the Baxter Creek (called About), a general overview of the Baxter Creek (called Baxter Creek), annual water flow data (called Flows), filtered Strahler Stream Order data (called Headwaters). Elevation Profile generating (Elevation). 
A separate LiDAR page was also created using the LiDAR tree canopy and super canopy map. Each page including the LiDAR page contains text that walks the user through how to use the corresponding page. 
The final page that was created was the Tracing page. Due to licensing issues, the trace network for the hydrology deliverable was not able to be published to AGOL. For an alternative, a Tracing Map was created in Map Viewer Classic with the stream direction layer added to it. This map allowed users to perform analysis such as downstream tracing and creating watersheds. However, to use the analysis, the map had to be embedded instead of connected through a widget. This means that the user would have access to the BCWA account and data which would be unadvised for public use. Therefore, two Watershed Characterization Web Experiences were created (one for members of the Baxter Creek and one for the public). The administrator web experience contained the Tracing page where the public one did not. 
Widgets such as Map, Legend, Map Layers, Elevation Profile, Feature Info, Filter, Chart, Text, Image, Embed, Menu, Section, and Views Navigation were all used to create the format of the web experience. A BCWA disclaimer was also added through a pop-up start-up window for the public web experience. An admin guide was also created for the client to adjust the app further if needed.

<h3>Watershed Map Series</h3>

<p>The map series used geovisualization techniques to communicate complicated geographic information relevant to the BCWA’s operations. The maps were made overtime with constant consultation with the client. They have common map surrounds showing unity throughout the map series, these surrounds included, title, subtitle, credits statement, release date statement, source statement, supplemental text explaining the map theme, a legend, north arrow, scale bar, scale statement, projection statement, BCWA logo, and an inset map of the Otonabee sub-watershed delineations highlighting Baxter Creek.
Firstly, the reference map is made to not favour any particular features over others visually. It balanced water features, road, rail, built-up area/buildings, wetlands, woodlands, watershed/municipal boundaries, contours, and annotations. To not obscure the Esri hill shade 40% transparency was added to the wetland and woodland features which made up most of the symbolized area on the map. This transparency was not added to the water features since bathymetry was not of interest to the map. The built-up areas also do not include transparency since they take up relatively little space, were mostly flat, and significant elevation changes were still conveyed through the contours. The map also includes the boundaries of the old jail property since the BCWA hopes to make this a protected area for conservation, making a reference of its extents important, is also has transparency to show the features that would be protected under it.
Secondly, the super canopy map showed the tree canopy model and pulled visual weight toward to the super canopy trees by making them a much darker green than the other point data, and by using insets where significant clusters were present within the Baxter Creek Watershed. This map uses the same extent as the reference map and uses the same contextual information, but refrains from symbolizing, the wetlands, woodlands, and built-up areas as these would distract from the map theme. It also uses the Esri terrain to avoid having too much whitespace and to give the character of the study area. 
Thirdly, the geology map shared the same extent and contextual information as the previous two maps. Aside from said contextual layers, the map symbolized surficial geology as its main theme, with colours chosen to be associated with each geology type, and with 40% transparency so that the character of the study area’s terrain could be seen via the Esri hill shade, which is an important feature for a geology map.
Lastly, though the indigenous engagement print map is considered part of the series its methodology will be covered in section 2.2.4.
All the maps were designed on Esri’s ArcGIS Pro. 

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Secondary Deliverables</h2> 

<h3>Watershed Watch Application and Web Map </h3>

<p>The Watershed Watch Application and Web Map was started by creating a point feature class to capture data. The client-specified capture categories and user input fields were defined and added to the feature through domains. The Quick Capture application then was created and connected to the point data layer which automatically created the categories from these domains and fields. 
Categories for this application were client-specified and include Spill, Water Quality, Water Quantity, Erosion, Rare Plant, Heritage Tree, Dangerous Plant, Invasive Species, Animal, Animal of Concern, Injured Animal, Rare Animal, and Other.
Groups and buttons were then organized and customized in an intuitive design. Appearance options, such as colors, borders, and button icons, were then added for each button. Settings such as displaying the map after capture, displaying photo icon, and limiting photo input to 1. 
Button and Project user input variables were then added. The Button user input variables come up after a capture was taken and the location was set on the map whereas the Project user input variables come up as soon as the application is open. For this application, the Button user input variable was called Description and set as a multi-line text input for the user to explain their observation and the Project user input variable was called First and Last name and set as a single-line text input to take the name of the user. These two variables must be connected to text fields created in the point feature class and set as required questions. 
Data captured through the application was stored in the point layer of the feature class. It was then uploaded to a map in the QAQC dashboard for review. This QAQC dashboard follows the same format as the Amphibian Monitoring Program’s. Once reviewed and accepted, the capture data was then uploaded to the public facing dashboard and connected to the BCWA’s website.
Due to Esri licensing, the Quick Capture application was unable to be shared to the public. Although the client sent in a request for discounted licensing options, a Survey 123 replacement was created. 
The Watershed Watch Survey 123 follows the same format as the Quick Capture application where the user entered their First and Last name, selected a categorized capture field, enters a description, and then selected the camera icon to capture an image or the folder icon to add an image from storage. This was also connected to the QAQC dashboard process where the administrator could review the captures before uploading to a public facing web map and dashboard. An administrator guide was created for the application and shared with the client. 

<h3>LiDAR Derived Surface Canopies Network layer</h3>

<p>In this deliverable, the BCB created a Canopy Height Model (CHM), a tree point layer, a super canopy tree layer and a public map for visualization. To create these products, the BCB first obtained LiDAR data for the area of Baxter Creek from the Ontario GeoHub. The BCB obtained 127 tiles of LiDAR which covered 92% of Baxter Creek (76km2/82km2) the other 8% did not get LiDAR taken in that area. The CHM was created by using ArcGIS Pro and a Forestry LiDAR tool known as FUSION. 
FUSION is a tool created by the US Department of Agriculture and is used by foresters to pinpoint forests using LiDAR files. The BCB used a series of tools in FUSION to create the CHM, specifically, the BCB used “Grid Surface Create” which creates the ground model out of the LiDAR tiles, “Canopy Model” which creates a CHM out of the created surface model from the previous tool, “DTM to Tiff” to create a tiff file of the CHM and “Canopy Maxima” to create a Comma Separated Values file (CSV) (definition in list of terms, 0.1)  of all the tree points in the area.
 Once these were created, the files were brought into ArcGIS Pro, specifically the CSV of tree points which was converted into a point layer by using the tool “XY table to point”. Once the points were displayed, a spatial join was conducted on the table through its height field to compare all the heights of each tree with each other within a 15m radius. Then the super canopy trees were pinpointed by using a select tool of trees that were at least 30m in height and on average at least 8m above the trees around them. This method was used in a previous study conducted at the University of New Brunswick where the selected trees were 95% accurate in finding super canopy trees (Tishler et al., 2020).  After the super canopies were singled out, the BCB created a visually appealing map for the public to observe and explain the findings. 

<h3>Hydrology Network Database and Web App</h3>

<p>The hydrology network database was first created by downloading the Ontario Integrated Hydrology (OIH) from LIO and bringing it into ArcGIS Pro. A trace network was then created in a feature dataset by using the watercourse and junction layer. Network Topology was then enabled after creating and setting a length network attribute in the Trace Network. Finally, flow direction was displayed for the network, downstream tracing was tested successfully by creating points, and the network was saved in the file geodatabase.
The next aspect of this deliverable was to create a specific Strahler stream order layer. This was done using the stream raster and flow direction raster from the OIH data and perform the Stream Order tool. The layer was then symbolized by stream order and published to AGOL. 
Due to Esri licensing, the Trace Network could not be published to AGOL and instead Map Viewer Classic was used to perform the tracing functionality in the Watershed Characterization Web Experience. The Strahler stream order layer was successfully published, made into its own map, and then filtered in the Watershed Characterization Web Experience to show headwaters (stream order 1, 2, and 3).

<h3>Indigenous Engagement Map</h3>

<p>This map was created in two formats, first the print format will be covered, then the web format will be covered.
Firstly, the main features of interest on this map were the indigenous reserve lands, followed by the treaties, and the watershed boundaries. The map also included, wooded areas, wetlands, built up areas, roads, and water features for context. The reserves were emphasized by being at the top of the drawing order with 1pt black strokes and a very saturated orange fill. Orange was chosen because it contrasted with the rest of the map, having the most visual weight, and had cultural significance for the communities, though red would have held more weight it was eschewed for its negative connotation. Reserve lands outside the study area were symbolized with yellow, which has less weight than orange but was still culturally significant. The treaty boundaries were also symbolized in orange, with an extra white stroke below to make them pop a little more against the other features. Additionally, treaty 20 is emphasized through feathered borders, which had a symbology that gradually fades from a full saturated colour into being fully transparent. The main watershed boundary was also emphasized through feathering, other watersheds were symbolized through blue dashed strokes which decreased in thickness as they become sub-watersheds. The contextual features were muted with desaturated colours that had transparency so that the Esri hill shade could be seen through them. Since there were significantly more lakes in the north of the map, the lakes were symbolized with a gradient fill to pull more weight back towards the south where the lakes were generally larger, this also gives the illusion of bathymetry. The rivers were symbolized relatively lightly; however, the water flow was emphasized through a smaller scale river dataset which was darker and used arrows in the mid-point of the line to show the flow direction, giving the viewer an overall idea of how the waterways flowed. In terms of typography, the treaty labels were the largest and had orange halos to associate them with the treaty boundaries. Additionally, the next largest were the reserve labels which were completely black, associating them with the black stroke on the reserve symbology, and having a large amount of visual weight comparatively to other labels. Other labels were there for context but were deemphasized through smaller fonts and lighter colors. Waterbody labels followed convention by being blue, italicized, and in Times New Roman. Watershed labels had a little more weight, matching the darker blue of the watershed boundary symbology and specifying that they were watersheds in the label, they were also not italicized and in a different font and size to further differentiate them from the water features labels, they also followed visual hierarchy principles by being smaller for sub-watersheds. For roads, anything lower than arterials were not symbolized at all and only the highways were labelled. Place name labels below a certain population were not labelled and are a light grey the point layer itself had no symbology applied being associated with the built-up areas. Built up area symbology was differentiated from the natural features by being pink but were very feint, so the contrast did not distract from the main features, making them visually distinct while still being a background contextual feature. Lower tier municipality borders were symbolized with a grey dashed line, and small light grey labels. Through these symbology choices the map effectively conveys the main features with context and minimal visual clutter. The map was designed entirely on Esri’s ArcGIS Pro.
As for the web map, it symbolized reserves in the same way, except there were no de-emphasized yellow reserves since the map was interactive and should balance all the reserves visually in the province. Likewise, there were no feathered boundaries in this map since emphasizing one area made little sense. The treaty boundaries were orange, as were their labels. The primary watershed boundaries hade semi-transparent fills and white boundaries making it easy to tell which primary watershed was in view at any scale range, the secondary hade 2 pt blue dashed lines, tertiary 1pt blue, and quaternary 0.5pt blue, this gave them visual hierarchy if viewed all at once. Baxter Creek was emphasized with a red boundary since it was the BCWA’s area of interest. The map used the OSM Esri base map by default so that wooded areas, wetlands, and water features were present for context without having to use provincial datasets which would be bad for performance. The base map also included other contextual layers like locations and roads. The web map was hosted on AGOL so it could easily be integrated into the BCWA website through the API and embedded in the StoryMap.
